For the Final Project, you will implement a turn-based, text (adventure) game in C++, or another similar interactive concept. The minimum requirements for the project can be found below. From known games, suggested examples include Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Final Fantasy, and MUD. Of course, you are encouraged to come up with a novel and unique idea in order to distinguish your project from the others.

<h1>Requirements</h1>

The only (minimum) requirement for this final project is that you include the following programming features in a C++ program:




<strong>Implementation requirements</strong>:​

<ul>

 <li>3 user-defined classes (one class can be a driver class)</li>

 <li>4+ data members in two of the classes</li>

 <li>6+ if-else statements</li>

 <li>4+ loops (while loops, for loops, do-while, in total)</li>

 <li>2+ nested loops</li>

 <li>File IO (both reading from a file and writing to a file)</li>

</ul>




<strong>Project feature requirements</strong>:​

<ul>

 <li>The project must have interactive components (ask the player for inputs, create menus for choices, and so on). It’s a game!</li>

 <li>Game stats should be displayed at each turn. It’s more exciting and meaningful! Also, these stats help debug the code.</li>

 <li>Your project must include:</li>

</ul>

○    At least 5 menu options (other than Quit/Exist)

○    At least two of these options must have a second layer of menu options

○    At least 2 menu options(primary or secondary layer of the menu) should include a random component, at least one each from the following:

■    The value of the variable is selected at random from a certain range of values (i.e. select a value at random between 1 and 6)

■    A probability value determines one of the outcomes (i.e. there is a 60% change a certain event will occur)

<h1>Extra Credit</h1>

<strong>Option1: Implement a sorting algorithm. </strong>Write your implementation of sorting algorithm​

—  do not use a Library function or any outside resources) and apply it to a task in your program

<strong>Option2: Present your project in a video.</strong> Make a 5 minute (+ or – 1 min) video​        explaining:

<ul>

 <li>The project idea</li>

 <li>Implementation ana approach</li>

 <li>A demonstration of the working project</li>

</ul>
